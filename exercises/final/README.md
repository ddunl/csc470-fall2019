For my final project, I am going to expand upon my last game and make a more refined tower defense game.
As before, the core mechanic will be using towers to defend against waves of enemies. 
### Core Mechanic
This time, I will make it possible to place towers in different locations, and have more interesting upgrade paths. Most good tower defense games have a large variety of towers with interesting tradeoffs between towers. I hope to achieve the same feeling with my game.
### Input
For input, I will use the mouse to select units and upgrades as well as use quality of life settings like making the game faster or slower. Maybe I will add keyboard shortcuts down the line if any seem like obvious improvements for the user experience.
### Visual Style
The visual style of my last game was created out of basically arbitrary google poly models,this time I think I will try to change the normal sentiment of tower defense games
and make the towers help the "enemies". One idea I had for this was having the towers hydrate the runners as they pass by, and you lose if 
you fail to hydrate a certain number of the runners in the race. I'm not sure if this is the exact way I'd like to present the idea, but something along these lines.

### Audio Style
Keeping with the theme of runners in a race, I will make the runners make some sort of refreshed noise after they are hydrated (perhaps a gulping sound). As well as ambient noise of people running. 

### Interface
Last time, I used a pop up panel to access the menu for each tower, but I don't think it went as well as it could have. This time around I will use a static panel
on a designated space on the screen to make it possible for the menu to be bigger. I'll also add a highlight to a selected unit so that the user knows which tower/unit they selected.

### Story
The game's story will be about hydrating runners in a race, so you can upgrade the towers to pour water quicker, or maybe have
Gatorade instead of water. The player can get bonus points for giving different runner's their favorite type of drink. In this way the goal of the game is reversed from normal tower defense games:
you want as many "enemies" as possible to get to the end of the level as quickly as possible, instead of preventing the enemies from reaching the end. 


# Feature set targets

## Low-Bar
I will make different types of runners that will prefer water or gatorade along with all of the features described above.

## Reasonable Target
Above, but there will also be towers that inflict status effects (in this case, speeding the runners up, cooling them down etc), 25 different waves of enemies (runners).


## High-Bar
Above, but there will be a pause and play menu, unique sound effects and particle effects for enemies and towers, a large variety of different drinks
that can be served to the runners. I'll also have pop up information panels about different types of runners and towers that explain the mehcanics of the game to the user.


## Timeline
I will likely not be able to work on this project until after some of my other final projects and job related work slows down a bit. 
Here is an overview of how I plan to accomplish this. 
First, I'll rework the code from the previous object such that I can place different Towers and set a path for the "enemies" to follow on the level. Once I have a coherent setup for having different types of towers that can be placed and selected, I'll work on the runners and designing all the possible attributes. I'll also during this time try to think of boss waves, perhaps a runner that is EXTREMELY thirsty and has to be given gallons and gallons of water to make it to the finish. 
Once I have at least a few solid working enemies, I'll work on structuring the waves and fine tuning the numbers so that the game feels challenging but not unreasonable. Last time, I struggled with this part much more than I thought I would, so making this game feel less rigid is a big priority. Without this part done well, it will be hard for the game to really feel fun. I hope to finish everything besides the wave and level setup prior to the week before the project is due, and finish and polish the game during the last week.
