## Game design document

For this game, I will make a tower defense style game where the towers have options and potentially upgrades. There will be health and gold resources like a normal tower defense games, with waves of enemies.

For the technical details, I will need to update a menu based on selected units, update the towers based on selected units, and offer a UI that allows the player to see their health, gold, and information about the towers and enemies.
